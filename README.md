# Vehicle Vs. Non-Vehicle Classification

Machine Learning (ML) is a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It provides a machine "intelligence" to act more and more like humans. The smarter ML is, the more it helps us as humans to accomplish our goals. It can achieve the narrow AI (machines or robot that performs humans' specific task e.g. classify an image, recognize a voice, detect fraud, etc.) through a system or model that can find a pattern from data and learn from it to make a prediction. ML itself divides into four main types. There are:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Transfer Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning
